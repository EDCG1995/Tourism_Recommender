903,Powerscourt Waterfall,"Powerscourt Waterfall is Ireland's highest at 121m (398ft). It is set in North County Wicklow just outside Enniskerry Village. The magnificent Waterfall cascades down over the granite rocks from the peatlands above. The crystal clear water flows down to the river below where it continues on its journey out to sea at Bray. The valley itself was carved out by a glacier during the ice age! Today Powerscourt is a haven for some of Ireland's wildlife, flora and fauna. The Sikka deer were first introduced here by Lord Powerscourt in 1858. The Waterfall is best seen just after heavy rain and the sheer volume of water and noise is certainly a sight to behold. The Waterfall is an ideal location for summer picnics and barbecues. There is a vast amount of space to keep children entertained. There is also a playground for younger children. Don't fret if you forget your picnic as there is a kiosk on site that serves everything from coffee and tea to hot-dogs and ice-cream. The kiosk is open everyday from the 1st June to the end of August and year round at weekends, if weather permits. There is ample car parking and toilet facilities at the waterfall. Dogs are welcome but they must be on a leash.

1160,City Hall,"City Hall was built between 1769 and 1779. The build took ten years to complete. When they decided to build City Hall a competition was advertised and 62 submissions were made. The winner of this Competition was Thomas Cooley, a young architect from London. At the time, James Gandon would have been the primary architect in Dublin, but his designs came second in the competition. Thomas Cooley was also tendered to build the Four Courts, however at 44 years of age, he fell ill and died and therefore James Gandon became the primary architect in the building of the Four Courts. If you look to the ceiling you will see that there is a stained glass dome, initially this was meant to be left open, in the same vein as the Pantheon, however given that we are in Ireland and it rains so often, they decided to cover it in. The stone work was done by a German man called Simon Vierpyl, and the stuccodore responsible for the gilded work was a man called Charles Thorpe. Initially when City Hall was built, it was built as The Royal Exchange. This was where you would have come to exchange Irish Punt into English Sterling. This was where merchants and guildsmen gathered to discuss their trading affairs. If you look out the West door onto Castle Street, that was where the banks were located and if you look out the windows to the east, where the trading happened. Over by the Olympia Theatre was where debts were collected. This really was an epicentre of trade in Dublin for the later part of the 18th Century. The Wide Streets Commission used the building in the late 1780s and 1790s to meet to discuss the planning of the city. If you walk around the outer ring of the Rotunda, you will notice that there is a distinct echo, this was done intentionally. When Thomas Cooley was designing the building, he designed it so that the echo would muffle private conversations that were had when walking around the room. Upstairs, in what are now the Council Chambers, there were coffee rooms. Coffee House Culture in the Dublin in the 18th and 19th Century was quite popular. Coffee was a luxury item and therefore very expensive to buy, and this made it very fashionable in those days. In 1800 the Act of Union was introduced and this had a devastating effect on the economy in Dublin, and by 1827 the currency was amalgamated. The building fell into disuse and was then rented out. This was actually where O’Connell gave his first public address on the Act of Union and it is one of his most famous addresses. In 1852 this building was bought by Dublin City Council, and they had partitions put up for privacy. Since then, in 1998- 2000 Dublin City Council restored the building to it’s original state as part of a refurbishment plan for the millennium.",4.0,Architectural Buildings • History Museums • Government Buildings,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/7c/03/b9/city-hall.jpg?w=900&h=600&s=1,2,9,59,162,105,337,https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g186605-d216200-Reviews-City_Hall-Dublin_County_Dublin.html

1482,Smock Alley Theatre 1662,"Dublin's newest oldest theatre. Enjoys contemporary takes on the classic and the excitement of the emerging artist. Smock Alley was the first Theatre Royal built in Dublin. John Ogilby opened it in 1662 as part of the Restoration of the British monarchy and King Charles II in 1660, along with the London’s Drury Lane (1662) and the Lincoln’s Inn Fields (1661). It was the first custom-built theatre in the city and still remains in substantially the same form, making it one of the most important sites in European theatre history. For more than a century, Smock Alley put Irish theatre on the European map, acting as the very core of an Ireland striving to find its own voice. If we are to ask historically what makes theatre such an important part of culture today, we would need to go back more than two centuries before the founding of The Abbey Theatre, to the Smock Alley Theatre of the 17th century.",4.5,Theatres,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/9d/96/cc/the-upper-room.jpg?w=900&h=600&s=1,1,2,5,17,106,131,https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g186605-d3365821-Reviews-Smock_Alley_Theatre_1662-Dublin_County_Dublin.html

Architecturally, the building marks the transition from the medieval Tower House to the Renaissance style manor house with complimentary influences from both periods. Following the fire and the ravages of time, the castle degenerated into a roofless shell.

In 2009 Triskel began a process of re-invention, partly because Christchurch, a beautiful 18th Century building, was to be restored by Cork City Council, linked to the existing building, and given to Triskel to manage. Triskel also began this process because it is important to continue to be relevant for artists, practitioners and the public at large.
